      <description>This is my first post! Welcome to my website! I am mostly just figuring out how Hugo works for now, but I have to say it looks very promising.
(There isn&amp;rsquo;t much else to see on this post, it is mostly a test/placeholder. You can leave this page, I promise there isn&amp;rsquo;t a hidden link or anything.)</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Saya. ðŸ‘‹ I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer Science engineer with a specialty in Robotics and Embedded Systems. ðŸ¤– I am currently looking to pursue my studies through a PhD. in HRI (Human-Robot Interaction) in France or anywhere in the world, really. I am also open to hiring opportunities as an engineer, bonus points if it&amp;rsquo;s for research in robotics and HRI in particular.
I dream of becoming a researcher and a teacher one day, in order to gather as much knowledge as I can since I love learning, as well as sharing that knowledge to anyone else who might be interested in it.</description>
