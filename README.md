# saya-rbt.github.io

This repo contains the code for my personal website, hosted at [https://saya-rbt.github.io](https://saya-rbt.github.io).

A GitHub Actions pipeline handles building and deploying it to GitHub Pages.

This website is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the theme [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/).

Some posts here are drafts, I don't know if I'll finish them one day, but at least they're hosted somewhere.
