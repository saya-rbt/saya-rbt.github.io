## Hi! I'm Saya. ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a research engineer in HRI and social robotics. ðŸ¤–

I dream of becoming a researcher and a teacher one day through the acquisition of a PhD., in order to gather as much knowledge as I can since I love learning, as well as sharing that knowledge to anyone else who might be interested in it.

For now, I've worked on a lot of different things, both through my studies as well as my personal projects. Most recently, I've been working on robots to make them interact with humans through pose estimation, head tracking, sounds and touch interactions. The code for it isn't available here just yet as it's unfinished and unpolished, so I would still like to clean it a bit before sharing it.

If you want to contact me, don't hesitate to send me an email on the following address: saya-rbt@protonmail.com, or through my personal email address if you know it.

Thank you for reading and please enjoy your browsing ðŸ˜Š

## FAQ

### What to expect on this website?

This website will host some write-ups of projects I've worked on, as well as thoughts and ideas. Sometimes, you might see ideas I started exploring but never quite explored it fully, but that I felt like sharing or documenting anyway.

I also usually use [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) whenever I want to make a presentation, since I find it very comfortable to use. If I feel like some of these presentations might be worth sharing, I will host them here as well.

I also have opinions and thoughts on other topics than robotics or computer science, and whenever I'll feel like having a platform to share them is a good idea I'll probably use this website.

### There is something on this website I would like to discuss with you/I would like to contact you for business/projects/anything, where can I reach you?

I will be glad to discuss anything you might be interested in sharing with me! Please send me an email at saya-rbt@protonmail.com.

### How is this website made?

This website is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), using the theme [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-papermod/).

The code for this website might be made available publicly in the future, or not, I haven't decided that part yet. It really isn't anything fancy anyway, it's really just a basic Hugo website with a specific theme.

As for any [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) presentation I might host here, I *might* also make them open-source if I feel like it, and I'll decide for each one specifically.

In general for this website as well as anything I do on the internet, nothing is set in stone and I reserve myself the right to make it public or not.
